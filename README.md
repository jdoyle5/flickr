[Photosphere](https://photosphere-aa.herokuapp.com/#/) is a web application inspired by 500 Pixels and Flickr. It allows users to create a gallery of photos to show to other users. 
## Technologies Used
* PostgreSQL
* Ruby on Rails
* React.js
* Redux
* JQuery
* SCSS

## Features
* Authenticated user accounts
* User can comment on photos
* User can like photos
* User can view photos by tags
* gallerys organized by tag, user, etc.


### Photos
Users can view the photo index on the site upon logging in, as well as the drone, portrait, and landscape gallerys.

### Liking Photos
Users can like/unlike any photos on any other user's gallery as well as their own photos on their own gallery.

### Tags
Photos can be grouped by tags and put in to their own gallerys. Tags for a specific photo will be added to the photo show page and are direct links to each tag photo gallery.

### comments
Users can leave comments on each individual photo in a gallery. They can also delete comments that belong to them
